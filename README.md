Building Quackle:
-----------------
Quackle runs automated GitHub CI builds on Qt 5.12 and 5.15, so it should work with any Qt version in that range.
See README.MacOS and README.Windows for platform-specific instructions.  Generally:

Clone the repo or download the tarball and untar.  Use cmake to build quacker, which will automatically build quackle and quackleio:

	cd quacker
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	cmake --build .

The binary will build as 'Quackle'.

If you're building with Qt provided by cmake, then invoke cmake as...

	cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path_to_vcpkg>/installed/<arch>" ..

The Quackle cmake build system uses Qt5 by default.  But you can specify Qt6 by invoking...

	cmake -DQT_VERSION=6 ..


File organization:
------------------
* quackle/ - libquackle sources.  libquackle is the engine, and can be linked to any convenient interface.  It does not use Qt.
* quackle/quackleio/ - I/O library for Quackle.  Implements stuff for accessing dictionaries, serializing GCG files, etc.  Also, command-line option handling.  This does have some modest dependencies on Qt.
* quackle/quacker/ - code for full Quackle UI.  Written in Qt, and requires libquackleio and libquackle.
* quackle/makeminidawg/ - standalone console program for building Quackle dictionaries.
* quackle/makegaddag/ - standalone console program for building gaddag files.
* quackle/data/ - lexicons, strategy files, and alphabet resources for Quackle.
In this directory is libquackle. Run qmake and then run make in this directory. Then cd to quackle/quackleio/, run qmake, and then run make.
